Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• Native Dark Mode
• Native accents menu by holding down a key on the keyboard
• Native tabs by enabling the "Prefer tabs" system preference
• Native full screen mode
• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, please click on the "Support" link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice adds the following new features:
• VoiceOver support: We have finally succeeded in making the LibreOffice accessibility code work within NeoOffice's multithreaded architecture. With this change, NeoOffice now has support for VoiceOver and possibly other macOS accessibility features. Also, we have upgraded the LibreOffice accessibility code to use Apple's newer, more efficient NSAccessibilityElement class to significantly reduce memory usage.
• Native popup menus: NeoOffice's underlying LibreOffice code does not support accessibility in its non-native popup menus so we have replaced most non-native popup menus with native menus.

Also, this version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• Fixed LibreOffice bug 145563 by adding separate fonts for each font's localized and unlocalized family and font names. This increases the likelihood of matching the family name in documents saved by OpenOffice and LibreOffice to an actual font.
• Fixed LibreOffice bug 150873 by adding code that resolves any macOS aliases in a file path before a file path is opened by NeoOffice's underlying LibreOffice code.
• Fixed a crash when quitting while NeoOffice is reloading a document by delaying document reloading when NeoOffice's quit handler code is running.
