Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• Native Dark Mode
• Native accents menu by holding down a key on the keyboard
• Native tabs by enabling the "Prefer tabs" system preference
• Native full screen mode
• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you buy NeoOffice, please click on the "Support" link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bugs:
• When using the Sifr icons while in Dark Mode, most Sifr icons were nearly impossible to see against the color of NeoOffice's toolbar background
• When using mail merge, NeoOffice would unexpectedly quit when transitioning between some of the panels in the Mail Merge Wizard and would fail to save the mail merge results
• When pasting HTML into a Writer document, NeoOffice would sometimes crash
• When undoing text that has been changed using the Chinese conversion dialog, LibreOffice bug #91995 would occur in NeoOffice
• When dragging images from the Finder, dropping the image into NeoOffice would fail


Promotional Text:
