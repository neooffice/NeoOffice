Description:
Paste the following paragraphs into the Description text area. Stop before the "Keywords" section:

NeoOffice is an office suite for Mac that is based on OpenOffice and LibreOffice. With NeoOffice, you can view, edit, and save OpenOffice documents, LibreOffice documents, and simple Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents.

Two engineers created NeoOffice in 2003 when they made OpenOffice run natively on OS X for the first time. Since then, the NeoOffice engineers have continually added improvements to NeoOffice that you will not find in OpenOffice or LibreOffice such as:

• Native Dark Mode
• Native accents menu by holding down a key on the keyboard
• Native tabs by enabling the "Prefer tabs" system preference
• Native full screen mode
• NeoOffice > Open at Launch menu to open Calc or Impress instead of Writer at launch
• File > Browse All Versions menu to restore previous versions of your documents
• Native file locking to safely edit files in iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or network drives
• Native Mac grammar checking
• Native Mac text highlighting
• Support for Mac Services
• Native floating tool windows


What's New in this Version:
Before you download NeoOffice, please click on the "Support" link and read the installation notes.

This version of NeoOffice fixes the following bug:
• Command-clicking on a hyperlink in a document would display a "fatal error" dialog and then crash if the hyperlink does not point to a local file. This bug was caused by our fix for LibreOffice bug 150873 that was added in the previous release to resolve any macOS aliases in a file path.
